# zScan - a Super simple subdomain scanner

The other day I was catching up to Joe Helle's Python 3 tools series on YouTube and got inspired to give the subdomain scanner a try. I'm not a coder so the code could be ugly, any feedback is welcome!


## Install

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## usage

    python zscan.py -d google.com


I'm going to add a few more features to this, like being able to specify how many subdomains to try. I would also like to gracefully handle CTRL+C events.

thanks!
